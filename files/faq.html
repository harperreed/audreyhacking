      <p><b><a name="What is an Audrey">What is an Audrey?</a></b></p>
      <p>Or, more to the point, <i>what in the bloody blue blazes is an Audrey?!</i></p>
      <p>An Audrey, or simply &quot;Audrey&quot; as we call here her at the Russo 
      household, is what is commonly known as an &quot;internet appliance&quot;.&nbsp; 
      Since you are using the internet, I'll assume you know what that is, but 
      what does it mean to be an internet appliance?&nbsp; Well, the theory is 
      that an appliance is a simple item in your home which has a single 
      purpose, or a very small number of purposes.&nbsp; It is easy to use, 
      accessible to anyone, plugs in and away you go.</p>
      <p>Clearly, your toaster is an appliance that browns bread.&nbsp; Your 
      refrigerator is an appliance that keeps your beer (juice, milk, film, dead 
      bodies) cold.&nbsp; Your Audrey allows you to browse the web, send and 
      receive e-mail, and keep a schedule handy for all members of the 
      household.</p>
      <p>Audrey is relatively small- about 14&quot; wide by 10&quot; tall.&nbsp; She has a 
      ~640x480 pixel touch screen that allows you to select items and change 
      cursor position via use of a stylus (a pen like device sticking out of the 
      top of her like an antennae).&nbsp; The stylus is clear, but blinks a cool 
      glowing green whenever she has mail for you or needs your attention.&nbsp; 
      She has a small wireless keyboard which can be conveniently hung on the 
      back of her.&nbsp; She has a couple small speakers in a metal bezel at the 
      top, which can play whatever sounds you encounter, and can even be used to 
      play music.&nbsp; Finally, Audrey comes in several cute colors- Linen 
      (white), Meadow (green), Ocean (blue), Slate (gray) and Sunshine (yellow).</p>
      <p>Here are some pictures:
      <a title="Linen Audrey with Stylus" href="images/audrey.gif">1</a>
      <a title="Linen Audrey with Stylus and Keyboard" href="images/aud_kb_styl.jpg">
      2</a> 3 4 5</p>
      <p>Common uses for an Audrey are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>leaving it on your kitchen counter so you and your guests can check 
        e-mail, search the web for recipes, etc.</li>
        <li>leaving it in a child's room so that they can have access to the 
        'net without the complication and maintenance requirements of a 
        full-blown PC</li>
        <li>giving it to people who are afraid of the internet, because it is so 
        cute and cuddly that what have they to fear?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is also the hacker element.&nbsp; (When I say hacker, I mean a 
      bunch of geeks like myself who love getting toys like this and digging 
      into their insides to play, which is basically what this FAQ is dedicated 
      to.)&nbsp; Hackers like to use the Audrey to do some pretty wild stuff.&nbsp; 
      For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>using it as a ever-changing picture frame</li>
        <li>using it to control lights and appliances in the house in

      <font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">Okay, so I took a break from
      looking into writing a block device driver for the compact flash and
      worked on getting a better keyboard file for the Audrey. After writing a
      photon app to capture the scan codes and a little reverse engineering of
      what was actually being sent I finally came up with a useful
      <a href="files/AudreyKB_replacement.tar.gz">keyboard
      file</a>.</font>
      <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">I changed the mapping of
      the following keys:<br>
      'Snapshot' -&gt; 'Esc' (it was a fluke that it was working as Esc)<br>
      'Copy' -&gt; 'Ctrl'<br>
      'Paste' -&gt; 'Alt'</font>

      <p><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman">While I was working on
      this I found that they somehow have the buttons sending F# key symbols to
      photon independent of the keyboard file. The other bad thing is that they
      appear not to accept Ctrl or Alt modifiers which would make them more
      useful. The scan codes the buttons produce are pretty screwy.</font>

      <p>Go into /data/XML/Channels. You'll see the names of the channels you currently have assigned to positions. Go into any one of them, then into the .template directory, and you'll see an
      index.shtml.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Then, create an index.shtml to send you to the URL of your choice!</p>

        <p>cd /data/XML/Channels/ABCNews<br>
        rm .template<br>
        mkdir .template<br>
        cd .template<br>
        </p>

      <p>Then make an index.shtml that redirects to <a href="http://www.abcnews.com"> www.abcnews.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To create the "index.shtml" file (comments in parenthesis - don't type those!):</p>
      <p>vi index.shtml (create the file)<br>
      O (get into insert line (and overall insert) mode using a capital O (not zero))<br>
      (type in all this)</p>

        <p>&lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;meta HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" CONTENT="0;URL=http://www.abcnews.com">&lt;/head><br>
        &lt;body>Transferring to &lt;a "href=http://www.abcnews.com">ABCNews&lt;/body><br>
        &lt;/html>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(the body stuff with the href is helpful if you mistype the meta refresh line)<br>
      (get out of insert/edit mode by hitting the snapshot key)<br>
      snapshot (don't type this, hit the snapshot key!)<br>
      :wq (write out changes and quit editor)<br>
      exit (exit the shell)</p>
      <p>
      The images and suplimental files for the channels are located at /data/XML/Channels/.Channelxx/. Replace the xx with a two digit number starting with 00.</p>
      <p>The Channel bar images are located at /data/XML/Channels/.Channel(xx)/Graphics/Graphic.gif. Each folder is set up the same and with the same filenames. Replace these images with 120 x 60 gifs.</p>
      <p>The images located at /data/XML/Channels/.Channel(xx)/Icon/Icon.gif</p>
      <p>The Icon directory with the Icon.gif in it is used for the user interface when selecting channels for the channel bar. I copied the single one that I had working(mkdir Icon;cp ....) into my user-defined channel, and that icon did appear in the "Select Channels" screen. So, the Graphic is for the channel bar, and the Icon is for the Selection screen.</p>
      <p>A really interesting directory to look at is the /data/XML/Channels/.Channel(xx)/URLs/Package/ direcotry. Looking through there, I was able to find a reference to yet another site that the Audrey gets it content. It is contained in the .attributes file. It refers to a URL at www.vs.aparato.net. When I tried this url on my PC and Audrey, both displayed a bunch of XML data that looked like a DTD. I am assuming this is where the channel is updated.... Yet another interesting directory is the
      ..../URLs/UpdateTable.</p>
      <p>If you set a shell access via channels, you can get permissions for running utilities by:</p>
      <p>pterm using Audrey Options<br>
      cd /bin<br>
      chmod a+x rm mkdir ln cat cp tar</p>
      <p>Voila, now when you pterm from Channels, you still have full file operation!</p>
      <p>In /kojak there are two files, boot.sh and configure.sh Inside boot.sh, there are a couple "ln" lines that create the links for the 6 core channels to point back to /data/XML/Channels/.waitingForUpdate/Template folder. If you modify this file, then whenever Audrey boots up, have the create the link for .template to the /Template folder, you can reboot and not lose the custom configured channel to your hearts desire.</p>
      <p>OR</p>
      <p>For unix newbies, once you get a shell, you can create a redirected link by doing the following:</p>
      <p>1) type: cd /data/XML/Channels/ABCNews/Template<br>
      2) type: rm .template<br>
      3) type: ln -s /data/XML/Channels/ABCNews/Template /data/XML/Channels/ABCNews/.template</p>
      <p>This will create a link to the current directory's Template folder. This will make it easier if you want to create customized channels. What did I do? I turned my ABCNews channel into a calculator.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>How to do it:</p>
      <p>### STEP 1 ###</p>
      <p>I downloaded a Macromedia Flash calculator (http://www.flashkit.com/movies/Applications/Scientif-Digital_-89/index.shtml) This one's a pretty cool one...does binary, hex, oct, as well as a bunch of other functions that aren't available in other flash calculators I've seen.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>### STEP 2 ###</p>
      <p>Store the .SWF file on some web hosting service like Geocities, Xoom. (If you have an FTP client, you can probably FTP it to the Audrey and store it in the Templates folder)</p>
      <p>### STEP 3 ###</p>
      <p>Delete /data/XML/Channels/ABCNews/Template/index.shtml</p>
      <p>Using VI, create a new index.shtml file and put the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&lt;HTML><br>
      &lt;HEAD><br>
      &lt;TITLE>intro&lt;/TITLE><br>
      &lt;/HEAD><br>
      &lt;BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><br>
      &lt;!-- URL's used in the movie--><br>
      &lt;!-- text used in the movie--><br>
      &lt;OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"<br>
      codebase="http://active.macromedia.com/flash2/cabs/swflash.cab#version=4,0,0,0"<br>
      ID=intro WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480><br>
      &lt;PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="intro.swf"> &lt;PARAM NAME=loop VALUE=false><br>
      &lt;PARAM NAME=menu VALUE=false> &lt;PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high><br>
      &lt;PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#AEC1C5><br>
      &lt;EMBED src="http://www.geocities.com/MYWEBPAGE/CALCULATOR.SWF" loop=false menu=false quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFF WIDTH=640 HEIGHT=480 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"><br>
      &lt;/EMBED><br>
      &lt;/OBJECT><br>
      &lt;/BODY><br>
      &lt;/HTML></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, make a note of the "&lt;EMBED Src=" line. Put in the URL for where you're storing the .SWF file. If it's local (ie: Template folder) then just put
      CALCULATOR.SWF.</p>
      <p>This should work with any ShockWaveFlash file, so just think of the possibilities here....games, To-Do list (hey, anyone good enough to create one that links to Yahoo Notepad or Yahoo Calendar)? Hey, maybe someone would like to make a
      YahooMessenger.SWF?&nbsp;</p>

      <a href="http://www.audreyhacking.com/~scythic">http://www.audreyhacking.com/~scythic</a> which will read/write to a raw disk.</p>
      <p>For my case, it's H: so I did: ntrw read size.img H:<br>
      This gives me a file size of 32112640 (ignore any errors that NTRW produces)&nbsp;
      Now, run the mkcf to get a correct checksum mkcf cf-image.bin cf-image.cf 32112640
      Finally, write it to disk ntrw write cf-image.cf H:</p>
      <p>Now, take the CF to the Audrey, power it off, stick it in (label facing towards the back), power the Audrey on while holding BOTH date-book and sleep.</p>

      This procedure was certified by David Chen.</i></p>
      <p>This is assuming that you have an Audrey updated to the Final version
      w/ Shell activated and Pterm active. CF card was straight out of the box,
      no formatting or alteration performed.</p>
      <p><i>CF Backup:</i></p>
      <p>1. Started a pterm via the Actions Palette.<br>
      2. Insert my generic 64Mb compact flash, it said 'CF inserted: 31493616
      bytes (30755 kB, 30 MB)'<br>
      3. Typed: devb-cf<br>
      4. Typed: cd /dev<br>
      5. Typed: cat fs0p0 fs0p1 fs0p2 &gt; /dev/cf</p>
      <p>Backing up takes about 2-3 minutes.</p>
      <p><br>
      <i>CF Restore:</i></p>
      <p>1) Unplugged the Audrey<br>
      2) Inserted the CF Card I made earlier<br>
      3) Made sure at least 1 min had elapsed from the time I first unplugged<br>
      4) Held down the Datebook AND Power buttons<br>
      5) Plugged the sucker back in....After a message indicating that the Flash
      Loader was being read and a short Flash Erase/Flash Write sequence (is the
      Flash Loader module re-flashing itself from the CF to the Audrey Flash ROM
      at this point?), it then cleared the screen and started a second longer
      Flash Erase followed by a Flash Write sequence. After which it cleared the
      screen again and instructed me to remove the CF Card. After which I was
      instructed to Unplug the Audrey.<br>
      6) Wait at least 30 sec, and then plugged in again and everything should
      be restored to previous flashed state.</p>
      <p>BTW, the CF card I used is labled on the front as: SanDisk 32 MB
      CompactFlash</p>
      <p>On the back: SanDisk CE SDCFB 99 SanDisk</p>

      <p>vi is a simple, yet powerful, text editor which is included with pretty
      much any UNIX-style operating system.&nbsp; It is modal, which can be a
      little confusing for some people, but you can learn the basics and get by
      reasonably well when hacking your Audrey.</p>
      <p>When you first start vi, you will be in navigation only mode.&nbsp;
      This means you can move your cursor around the file to view it or position
      it for when you are ready to make changes.</p>
      <p>&quot;i&quot; will put you in insert mode.&nbsp; This will allow you to
      insert characters wherever your cursor is.<br>
      &quot;o&quot; will insert a new line, then put you in insert mode.<br>
      the snapshot key will get you out of insert mode.<br>
      &quot;x&quot; will delete a single character.<br>
      &quot;dd&quot; will delete an entire line.<br>
      &quot;:wq&quot; will write and quit out.<br>

      <p>The command is /kojak/gpio -a 0x40010004 -b6 -m3 -s opt, where opt is a number between 0 and 3. 0 turns the screen off, 1 clears the screen, 2 seems to be the same as 0, and 3 turns the screen on.</p>

      <p>Note that when the browser exits, it rewrites the config file, so you need to do this immediately after booting and before running the browser, or just popup a shell. Do a "ps".

      <p>I have been annoyed by underruns (clicks, pops etc.) while playing MP3s from a shared windows directory on my audrey with
      phplay. I have written a shell script which improves the playback quality by setting a 5Mb input buffer. This eliminates network related problems, however it adds a significant delay to the startup of the song. I do still occasionally get underruns, and almost always get them while moving windows on the
      audrey.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Below is a copy of my shell script: Notice that I conditionally mount the windows shared directory. I thought it would be safer to do it here rather than in the boot scripts, since others have reported problems.</p>

      <p>After digging in and learning the QNX development environment, I've 
      completed my first audrey application. It is an onscreen keyboard that 
      allows you to enter text into *any* application. With it you can use your 
      Audrey without the keyboard and still enter text. It also has keys that 
      the real keyboard does not even have like ctrl, alt, esc so you can use 
      them without hacking your keyboard definition file.</p>
      <p>The executable is only 27K and is built with QNX 6.0 so you don't need 
      anything other than the executable.</p>

      Why are people using two different versions of QNX with the Audrey?</a></b></p>
      <p><i>Thanks to Chris Guthrie.</i></p>
      <p>The Audrey was shipped using QNX 6.0 as the operating system. Since 
      then, QNX has released QNX 6.1. Since it is much easier to get 6.1 many 
      people have hacked in programs from that release. Unfortunately, using 
      programs from 6.1 often requires installation of additional 6.1 libraries 
      that use up valuable memory on the Audrey. Thus for any serious 
      development, 6.0 is the preferred release.</p>

      <p align="left"><i>Step by Step Instructions:</i></p>
      <p align="left">cd /config<br>
      vi rm-apps<br>

      (about the 14th line is: rb,/kojak/kojak-slinger, -c -e -s -i 127.1)<br>
      (deleting the &quot;-i 127.1&quot; will allow it to respond to ANY request) (x under

      <p align="left">When updating the Audrey, you need to convince her that 
      3com.maribma.net is still alive and well.&nbsp; That's where the Audrey 
      updates come from.&nbsp; Presently Jason Roysdon has setup a spoofing DNS server 
      at <font color="#000000">63.172.195.4, which when you point Audrey at 
      it, it will tell you that 3com.maribma.net is actually at 63.172.195.4.&nbsp; 
      It is actually preferable that you point this to resolve to 2-1b.artoo.net 
      instead of the actual IP address, so that way Jason can change the IP 
      address at will.</font></p>
      <p align="left">The problem is that<font color="#000000"> some people have 
      forgotten to<b> </b>change their DNS settings back to normal after 
      completing the updates, thus causing a lot of Audreys to use poor madmax's 
      server and bandwidth constantly.&nbsp; Therefore, there is a chance that 
      when you go to perform this function, you may find that madmax has taken 
      down his service and you may have some problems.</font></p>
      <p align="left">If you are so nervy or technically inclined, you can setup 
      your own DNS server and create your own spoof entries for 3com.marimba.net 
      and marimba.3com.com and point both of them to <font color="#000000">
      63.172.195.4.&nbsp; Then you can point your Audrey to your DNS server and
