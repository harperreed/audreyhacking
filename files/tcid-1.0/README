Tivo Caller ID Client 1.0 (tcid)

This application is used to display Caller ID information using
Tivo's on screen display.  It is designed to work with the Caller ID
Client/Server for Audrey. (By koreth/davinci27)

tcid uses the following:

	http://tivo.samba.org/download/belboz/osdtxt.tar.gz
	blank.tiv (from the TiVo remotebash package)

	CallerIDSentry protocol devised by:
	http://home.houston.rr.com/jeffkohn/callerid_sentry.htm

	Audrey Caller ID CLient/Server:
	callerid-1.1.tar.gz
	http://culdesac.midwinter.com:8009/audrey/


For more information about Audrey, check out:

You need to have Caller ID service for this app to work.


INSTALLATION/USAGE:

Ftp the following files into "/hack/bin"

	tcid
	osdtxt
	blank.tiv

Make sure tcid and osdtxt are executable:

	chmod +x tcid
	chmod +x osdtxt

Now to run tcid, simply type the following:

	tcid <server ip>

Where <server ip> is the IP of the Audrey (or any other Caller ID
server that uses the CallerIDSentry protocol).

To exit, simply hit "Control-C".

I also included a copy of the Audrey CallerID Client/Server from
koreth.  To get the latest version, check his web site.

BUGS

Tivo's "gethostbyname" is broken, so it can only take an IP now.


TO DO

You can't change anything via the program arguements.  I'll fix
that really soon.  :-)
